# Next_word_predictor_using_LSTM

* This Neural Network model is built using LONG SHORT_TERM MEMORY (LSTM) model which is a special kind of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) model. 
* Google Collab and its resources (GPU) were used to build this model.
* It tool roughly an hour to train this model. 
* The model was trained with 70 epochs (iterations) which can further be increased to reduce the loss and improve our accuracy.
* We can use this model and train it with any other text file.
